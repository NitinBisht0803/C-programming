The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

RULES:


 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
